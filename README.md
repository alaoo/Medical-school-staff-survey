# Medical-school-staff-survey

**What are we doing?** 
We are carrying out a survey of UK medical schools to understand the level of data science in the
curriculum, medical schools’ understanding of data science, and to see how much exposure students
have to data science during their studies.


**Why another survey?**
Developing a healthcare workforce with strong skills in data science has become a focus of national
priority after a number of government and NHS reviews. Section 19 of the General Medical Council’s
Defined learning outcomes for the BMBS curriculum states that “Newly qualified doctors must be
able to use information effectively and safely in a medical context, and maintain accurate, legible,
contemporaneous and comprehensive medical records.”
Many healthcare providers have moved to electronic record keeping and this requires skills in data
science and data literacy. Furthermore, many medical specialties will increasingly use new
technologies such as Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning, exemplified by the increasing use
of AI in imaging. It will be important for all health care professionals to understand the advantages
and limitations of such technologies, and for some, there will opportunities to become highly skilled
at developing these technologies and their applications.
 
At present little is known about what data science training is currently offered to medical students
across the UK, beyond basic stats, whether they are happy with the current training provision, or
about what medical students think about data science in general.
Carrying out surveys of both educators and students will enable us to understand what data science
medical students are being taught and their awareness of its importance and potential, in order to
shape how medicine will be taught in future.
